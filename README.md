Module 4 Challenge - JavaScript Fundamentals

## Description:

This project was undertaken in order to improve my knowledge of Javascript utilising what I learnt in week 4 of the edx bootcamp. My aim was to take a 2D array, containing months and values, given to me in the starter code, and manipulate this array in order to log a range of outputs to the console.
